### 2. Creating `0-minoperations.py`
Create a `0-minoperations.py` file with the following content:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
"""
Module for minimum operations calculation
"""

def minOperations(n):
    """
    Calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly n H characters in the file.
    :param n: The target number of H characters
    :return: The minimum number of operations needed or 0 if n is impossible to achieve
    """
    if n <= 1:
        return 0
    
    operations = 0
    factor = 2
    
    while factor <= n:
        while n % factor == 0:
            operations += factor
            n //= factor
        factor += 1
    
    return operations
